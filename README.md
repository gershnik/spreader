Spreader is a portable C++ library that implements spreadsheet logic - reading and writing data and formulas into cells, automatic recalculation, copying and moving cells, adding and deleting rows and columns and so on. It does not implement any spreadsheet UI,
though the hope is that eventually it will be possible to write a UI based on it. 
It is currently in alpha stage.
